Json Schema Validator
As there aren't any requirements for JSON Schema Validator these questions should be asked
1. Which keys are required?
2. Is there any pattern which must be validated?
3. Do we need to add enums for parameters?
4. Do we need maximum and minimum values for Numeric values?
5. Are there any limitations for String parameters?
6. Do we have default values for keys?
